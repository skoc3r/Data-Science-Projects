# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various skills in data analysis, modeling, and deployment.

## Projects

### 1. Churn Analysis
- **Description**: Analyzes customer churn using machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Visualizations and insights
    
### 2. Exoplanet ESI Ranking
- **Description**:  This project analyzes exoplanetary data to compute the Earth Similarity Index (ESI), a quantitative measure of how similar an exoplanet is to Earth based on its stellar flux and planetary radius. The analysis ranks exoplanets by their ESI score, identifying the most potentially habitable candidates.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Preprocesses exoplanet data by handling missing values and removing duplicate observations
  - Implements a computational model to evaluate planetary habitability(ESI) 
  - Identifies and ranks the top 10 exoplanets with the highest Earth similarity
  - Visualizes the ESI distribution to highlight trends in planetary characteristics
