# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various skills in data analysis, modeling, and deployment.

## Projects

### 1. Churn Analysis
- **Description**: Analyzes customer churn using machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Visualizations and insights
    
### 2. Exoplanet ESI Ranking
- **Description**: Computes the Earth Similarity Index (ESI) for exoplanets based on their stellar flux and planetary radius, ranking the most Earth-like candidates.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Cleans and preprocesses exoplanet data
  - Computes ESI using a mathematical formula
  - Ranks exoplanets by ESI
  - Saves the top 10 Earth-like planets in a CSV file
  - Generates a scatter plot to visualize ESI distribution
